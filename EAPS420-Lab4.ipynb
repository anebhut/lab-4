    "The CESM is one example of complex coupled GCMS utilized by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report process.  It is developed and maintained at NCAR by a group of software engineers and climate processes.  The code is open-source, with new pieces contributed by a wide variety of users."

    "\n",
    "The CESM is a modular piece of software, meaning that a researcher can use which submodels to combine together to best answer their invididual research question with the computer power they have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pieces of the CSEM include:\n",
    "- Atmospheric model (AGCM): Community Atmosphere Model (CAM)\n",
    "    -- This model maintains a resolution of approximately 2º lat/long, meaning that while it resolves synoptic-scale dynamics like storm tracks and cyclones, it is not capable of resolving mesoscale and smaller events like thunderstorms or clouds.  The model conserves momentum, mass, energy, water, and the equation of state, while parameterizing weather phenomena and solving equations of radiative transfer based on the composition of the atmosphere, absorption properties of different gases, and the radiative effects of clouds\n",
    "- Ocean model (OGCM): Parallel Ocean Program (POP)\n",
    "    -- This model has a 1º lat/long resolution and models the exchanges of heat, water, and momentum in the atmosphere and sea ice.  It includes a full 3D simulation of the currents.\n",
    "- Land surface model: Community Land Model (CLM)\n",
    "    -- Like the atmospheric model, this model maintains a 2º lat/long resolution.  It's complex, but, in short, determined the surface fluxes of heat, water, and momentum based on vegetation types.\n",
    "- Sea ice model: Community Ice CodE (CICE)\n",
    "    -- This model has a 1º lat/long resolution.  It is incredibly complex and uses thermodynamics to determine freezing and melting and momentum equations to track ice motion and deformation."
